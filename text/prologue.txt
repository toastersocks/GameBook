DIAGNOSTICS

unified mp5 operating system version 11.6.0
unified mp5 operating system running unmodified and clean
unified mp5 operating system running in primer mode

CLOCK:
	manufacture time 5027 CE day 290 hour [[ something ]]
	current time 15031? CE day 041? hour ?
		ERROR 41A: calibration failure

INSTALLED HARDWARE MODULES:
	Database
	Sensors
	Telepathy 		[[ change to "communications"? ]]
	Interface
	Nanites

ENERGY: 
	Capacity at 3%.
	Power reserves are critical due to:
		entropic leakage over long time period
		back-drain from storage hardware
			Report possible malfunction to factory administrator.
	Projected activity duration: [[ NOTE: change these to all hours? or seconds? at some point ]] 
		extreme: 3 hours
		heavy: 3 days
		moderate: 3 weeks
		light: 3 months
		dormant: 30 years
			[[ NOTE: this gives maximum dormancy time of 1000 years. robot has had dormancy time 
			 of 10000 years. players may note discrepency? hopefully will realise this means something
			 has been active in robot's power management? diagnostic program could make a note of
			 this and make it quite obvious ]]
